### **Pertinent Results:**

* Admission glucose: 412 → 160 mg/dL at discharge

* VBG: pH 7.28, HCO₃ 15, AG 18 → normalized (pH 7.35, HCO₃ 21, AG 10\)

* Na 132 → 137, K 4.9 → 4.2, Cr 0.7 → 0.5

* HbA1c: 12.1%

* UA: glucose/ketones resolved

### **Condition at Discharge:**

* Vitals: T 98.1°F, HR 94, RR 18, BP 100/62, SpO₂ 99% RA

* Exam: Alert, interactive, no distress, well hydrated, tolerating diet

* Family demonstrated insulin injection and glucose monitoring competency

---

### **Discharge Medications:**

New:

* Insulin glargine 14 units SQ QHS

* Insulin lispro 1 unit per 15 g carbohydrate with meals \+ correction scale (1 unit per 50 mg/dL \>150)

* Glucagon emergency kit

* Supplies: glucose monitor, test strips, ketone strips, lancets

Continued:

* None

---

### **Follow-Up Appointments:**

* Endocrinology clinic in 1 week for insulin titration

* PCP in 3–5 days for post-hospital follow-up

* Diabetes educator in 2 weeks

* Ophthalmology referral in 6–12 months (baseline diabetic eye exam)

---

### **Diet and Lifestyle Instructions:**

* Resume regular age-appropriate diet with carbohydrate counting

* Encourage consistent meal times and snacks

* BG monitoring before meals and at bedtime (minimum 4 times/day)

* Sick-day management reviewed (BG q2–4h, ketones if BG \>250 mg/dL)

* Emphasize hydration, avoid sugary drinks unless treating hypoglycemia

---

### **Patient Instructions (Clinical Style):**

Family counseled extensively on new-onset diabetes care. Emphasized adherence to insulin regimen, recognition of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and importance of daily glucose monitoring. Sick-day rules reinforced. Patient and parents demonstrated competency in insulin injection technique and carb counting. Written materials and emergency contacts provided.

### **Return Precautions:**

Return to ED or call provider for:

* Persistent vomiting or inability to tolerate oral fluids

* BG \>300 mg/dL with moderate/large ketones

* Lethargy, confusion, or seizure activity

* Signs of hypoglycemia not resolving with oral glucose (shakiness, confusion, seizure, LOC)
