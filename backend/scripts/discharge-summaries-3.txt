The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of osteoporosis who presented to the ED after a fall from standing height at home. She complained of severe right hip pain and inability to bear weight. X-rays confirmed an intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur.

Orthopedic surgery was consulted and patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 1 for open reduction and internal fixation with a sliding hip screw. The procedure was completed without complications. Post-operatively, patient was started on DVT prophylaxis and pain management.

Physical therapy was initiated on post-operative day 1 with focus on mobility and weight-bearing as tolerated. Patient progressed well with physical therapy and was able to ambulate with a walker by discharge. Pain was well-controlled with oral analgesics.

Bone density scan confirmed severe osteoporosis. Endocrinology was consulted for osteoporosis management. Patient was started on bisphosphonate therapy and calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Fall prevention strategies were discussed with patient and family.
