### **Pertinent Results:**

* Admission glucose: 412 → 160 mg/dL at discharge

* VBG: pH 7.28, HCO₃ 15, AG 18 → normalized (pH 7.35, HCO₃ 21, AG 10\)

* Na 132 → 137, K 4.9 → 4.2, Cr 0.7 → 0.5

* HbA1c: 12.1%

* UA: glucose/ketones resolved

---

### **Condition at Discharge:**

* Vitals: T 98.1°F, HR 94, RR 18, BP 100/62, SpO₂ 99% RA

* Exam: Alert, interactive, no distress, well hydrated, tolerating diet

* Family demonstrated insulin injection and glucose monitoring competency

---

### **Discharge Medications:**

New:

* Insulin glargine 14 units SQ QHS

* Insulin lispro 1 unit per 15 g carbohydrate with meals \+ correction scale (1 unit per 50 mg/dL \>150)

* Glucagon emergency kit

* Supplies: glucose monitor, test strips, ketone strips, lancets

Continued:

* None

Stopped:

* None

---

### **Follow-Up Appointments:**

* Endocrinology clinic in 1 week for insulin titration

* PCP in 3–5 days for post-hospital follow-up

* Diabetes educator in 2 weeks

* Ophthalmology referral in 6–12 months (baseline diabetic eye exam)

---

### **Diet and Lifestyle Instructions:**

* Resume regular age-appropriate diet with carbohydrate counting

* Encourage consistent meal times and snacks

* BG monitoring before meals and at bedtime (minimum 4 times/day)

* Sick-day management reviewed (BG q2–4h, ketones if BG \>250 mg/dL)

* Emphasize hydration, avoid sugary drinks unless treating hypoglycemia

---

### **Patient Instructions (Clinical Style):**

Family counseled extensively on new-onset diabetes care. Emphasized adherence to insulin regimen, recognition of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and importance of daily glucose monitoring. Sick-day rules reinforced. Patient and parents demonstrated competency in insulin injection technique and carb counting. Written materials and emergency contacts provided.

---

### **Return Precautions:**

Return to ED or call provider for:

* Persistent vomiting or inability to tolerate oral fluids

* BG \>300 mg/dL with moderate/large ketones

* Lethargy, confusion, or seizure activity

* Signs of hypoglycemia not resolving with oral glucose (shakiness, confusion, seizure, LOC)

### **Admitting Diagnosis (ICD-10):**

* New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (E10.9)

* Mild Diabetic Ketoacidosis (E10.10)

* Dehydration (E86.0)

---

### **Discharge Diagnosis:**

* Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, new onset, insulin-dependent

* Mild DKA, resolved

* Dehydration, corrected

---

### **Hospital Course:**

The patient is an 11-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with 2 weeks of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss (\~4 kg), and new-onset nocturnal enuresis. Two days prior to admission, she developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. On arrival, she was tachycardic (HR 128), mildly tachypneic (RR 28), and had dry mucous membranes.

Initial labs: glucose 412 mg/dL, Na 132, K 4.9, Cl 97, HCO₃ 15, AG 18, VBG pH 7.28, beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated. HbA1c 12.1%. UA: 4+ glucose, 3+ ketones. These findings were consistent with mild DKA.

She was admitted to the PICU for management. Started on IV fluids and insulin infusion at 0.05 units/kg/hr. Hourly glucose monitoring and frequent electrolyte checks were performed. Potassium supplementation initiated once urine output established. No arrhythmias noted. By HD\#2, acidosis resolved (pH 7.35, HCO₃ 21, AG closed), and patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin regimen (glargine nightly, lispro with meals and correction scale).

Diabetes education was initiated with patient and family, including insulin administration, glucose monitoring, carb counting, and sick-day rules. Social work assisted with insurance coverage for supplies. By HD\#4, patient was tolerating diet, demonstrating appropriate insulin injection technique, and BG stabilized between 120–200 mg/dL on basal-bolus regimen.
