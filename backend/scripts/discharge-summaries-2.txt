### **Hospital Course:**

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED with acute onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with diaphoresis and nausea. EKG showed ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF consistent with inferior STEMI. Troponin I was elevated at 15.2 ng/mL.

Patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where coronary angiography revealed 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery. Primary PCI was performed with successful placement of a drug-eluting stent. Post-procedure, patient's chest pain resolved and EKG normalized.

Patient was monitored in the CCU for 48 hours with no complications. Echocardiogram showed mild inferior wall hypokinesis with preserved overall left ventricular function (EF 55%). Patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and high-intensity statin.

Cardiac rehabilitation was discussed and patient was educated on lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and medication adherence. Patient demonstrated understanding of warning signs and when to seek immediate medical attention.
