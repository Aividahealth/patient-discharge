The pain was described as pressure-like, 8/10 in intensity. ## HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. Initial workup including cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponin levels consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The patient underwent urgent cardiac catheterization which revealed 95% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed. The patient's post-procedure course was uncomplicated. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and high-intensity statin. His pain resolved completely, and repeat ECG showed resolution of ST-segment elevation. ## DIAGNOSES 1. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 2. Coronary artery disease with 95% LAD stenosis - status post PCI with DES 3. Hypertension 4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ## PROCEDURES 1. Cardiac catheterization with PCI and drug-eluting stent placement to LAD (2025-01-10) ## MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE 1. Aspirin 81 mg PO daily 2. Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily (continue for at least 12 months) 3. Metoprolol succinate 50 mg PO daily 4. Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily 5. Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily 6. Metformin 1000 mg PO twice daily 7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual PRN chest pain ## DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS - Take all medications as prescribed - Do not stop aspirin or clopidogrel without talking to your cardiologist - Follow low-sodium, diabetic diet - Participate in cardiac rehabilitation program (referral provided) - Check blood pressure daily - Monitor blood glucose levels - Avoid strenuous activity for 2 weeks - **CALL 911** if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any concerning symptoms ## FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS - Cardiology: Dr. Michael Johnson - 1 week (appointment scheduled for 2025-01-22) - Primary Care: Dr. Sarah Lee - 2 weeks - Cardiac Rehabilitation: Contact within 3 days to schedule ## ACTIVITY - Light activity only for 2 weeks - No driving for 1 week - No heavy lifting (>10 lbs) for 2 weeks - Gradually increase activity as tolerated ## DIET - Low-sodium diet (<2000 mg/day) - Diabetic diet with carbohydrate counting - Heart-healthy Mediterranean diet recommended ## ADDITIONAL NOTES The patient has been educated about warning signs of heart attack and stroke. He understands the importance of medication compliance, especially antiplatelet therapy. Family members were also present for discharge education and understand the discharge plan. --- **Discharged by:** Dr. Jane Wilson, MD **Date:** 2025-01-15 **Time:** 14:30"

                      - generic: You came to the hospital on January 10, 2025, because you were having chest pain that spread to your left arm and shortness of breath. The pain, which you described as feeling like pressure, had been happening for about 2 hours. You have a medical history of high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes.
                    - generic:
                      - heading [level=3]: What Happened During Your Stay
                      - generic: You were admitted to the coronary care unit, a special unit for heart patients. Tests showed that you had a type of heart attack called an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). You had an urgent procedure called a cardiac catheterization on January 10, 2025. During this procedure, doctors found that a major blood vessel in your heart, the left anterior descending artery (LAD), was 95% blocked. They successfully placed a small tube called a drug-eluting stent to open the blocked artery. After the procedure, your recovery went well and your chest pain went away completely. A repeat ECG (a test that checks your heart's electrical activity) showed that your heart was improving. You were started on several medicines, including two types to prevent blood clots (dual antiplatelet therapy), a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a high-intensity statin. You were discharged on January 15, 2025.
