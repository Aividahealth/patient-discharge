Chest pain and shortness of breath

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath for the past 2 hours. The pain was described as pressure-like, 8/10 in intensity.

## HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. Initial workup including cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponin levels consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The patient underwent urgent cardiac catheterization which revealed 95% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed.

The patient's post-procedure course was uncomplicated. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and high-intensity statin. His pain resolved completely, and repeat ECG showed resolution of ST-segment elevation.
