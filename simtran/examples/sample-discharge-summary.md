# Discharge Summary

## Patient Information
**Date of Discharge:** January 15, 2024
**Admission Date:** January 10, 2024
**Length of Stay:** 5 days

## Admitting Diagnosis
- Acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- Hypoxemia

## Discharge Diagnosis
1. COPD with acute exacerbation, improved
2. Hypertension, controlled
3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, stable
4. Hyperlipidemia

## Hospital Course

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of progressive dyspnea, productive cough with yellow sputum, and subjective fever. He reported increased use of his albuterol inhaler without relief.

In the ED, vital signs were notable for temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 105 bpm, blood pressure 145/88 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. The patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress.

Initial laboratory workup showed WBC 14.2 x10^9/L with left shift, elevated procalcitonin at 0.8 ng/mL, and ABG demonstrating respiratory acidosis with pH 7.32, pCO2 52 mmHg, pO2 58 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflation without focal consolidation.

The patient was admitted to the medical floor and initiated on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, nebulizer treatments with albuterol and ipratropium q4h, systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125mg IV q6h transitioned to prednisone 40mg PO daily), and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 1g IV daily and azithromycin 500mg PO daily) for suspected bacterial superinfection.

Over the subsequent 4 days, the patient's clinical status gradually improved. His oxygen requirements decreased from 4L NC to room air. Wheezing diminished significantly, and the patient reported substantial improvement in his breathing. Repeat laboratories showed normalization of WBC to 8.5 x10^9/L and improved oxygenation.

- Glucose: 145 mg/dL
- Procalcitonin: 0.8 ng/mL (elevated)

**Arterial Blood Gas (on admission, room air):**
- pH: 7.32
- pCO2: 52 mmHg
- pO2: 58 mmHg
- HCO3: 26 mmol/L

**Chest X-ray:** Hyperinflation consistent with COPD. No acute infiltrates or pleural effusions.
